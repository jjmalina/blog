I'm a software engineer currently working on analytics at [NewsCred](http://newscred.com).

I graduated from NYU with a CS degree in 2013. Since then I've mostly been programming in Python, JavaScript, Scala and done a few experiments in Lua, Go and Clojure.

Aside from programming my other passions are surfing, snowboarding, cooking and [electronic music](https://www.discogs.com/user/jjmalina). I'm also currently playing Apex Legends and Battlefield V on PC.
